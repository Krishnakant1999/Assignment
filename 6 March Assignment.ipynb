Descriptive statistics aim to describe what has happened or what is observed in the data without making inferences beyond the analyzed dataset. Examples of descriptive statistics include:\n",

    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average value of a dataset and is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of observations. The mean represents the typical or central value of the dataset. It is commonly used when the data is normally distributed and has no extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves. The median is useful when the data contains outliers or is skewed, as it is not affected by extreme values. It represents the middle or central position in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a dataset. It represents the most common or dominant value(s) in the data. The mode is useful for categorical or discrete data, and it can also be used for continuous data. Unlike the mean and median, the mode does not depend on numerical calculations and can be determined by simple counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread or dispersion of the data. However, it is sensitive to extreme values and may not provide a robust representation of variability when there are outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean in a dataset. It quantifies the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean. Variance takes into account all values in the dataset and provides a more comprehensive measure of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It measures the average distance between each data point and the mean. Standard deviation is widely used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. It provides a measure of dispersion that is in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), we can describe the typical or central value of the data. Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation) help us understand the spread or dispersion of the data points around the central value. Together, these measures provide valuable information about the distribution, characteristics, and variability of the dataset, aiding in data analysis, interpretation, and comparison."
