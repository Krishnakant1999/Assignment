However, it only considers two values and does not take into account the distribution of values in between.\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of exam scores for a class of students: 65, 70, 75, 80, 85. The range would be 85 - 65 = 20, indicating that the scores span a range of 20 points.\n",

To calculate the variance, you first find the mean (mean = (1000 + 1200 + 800 + 900 + 1100) / 5 = 1000). Then, you calculate the squared difference of each value from the mean: (1000 - 1000)^2, (1200 - 1000)^2, (800 - 1000)^2, (900 - 1000)^2, (1100 - 1000)^2. Summing up these squared differences and dividing by the number of values (5) gives you the variance.\n",
